// 'Hello World' program in JavaScript:
console.log('Hello World');

// javaScript Defination:
// JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used for web development. It allows developers to create dynamic content, interactivity on websites, and is widely supported by browsers.
// Initially developed for client-side scripting in web browsers, JavaScript has evolved to be used for server-side development (Node.js), mobile app development, game development, and more.
// It was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was an engineer at Netscape. It was originally going to be named LiveScript but was renamed. Unlike most programming languages, JavaScript language has no concept of input or output.
// It is designed to run as a scripting language in a host environment, and it is up to the host environment to provide mechanisms for communicating with the outside world. 


// JavaScript coding conventions:

// Variable naming: Use camelCase for variables (e.g., myVariable), PascalCase for constructor functions or classes (e.g., MyClass), and UPPER_CASE for constants (e.g., MAX_SIZE).

// Semicolons: While JavaScript allows semicolon omission, it's recommended to use them to avoid potential issues.

// Indentation and Formatting: Maintain consistent indentation (usually 2 or 4 spaces) and use proper formatting for readability.

// Comments: Use descriptive comments to explain complex parts of your code. It helps other developers (or your future self!) understand the purpose of the code.

// Consistent Code Style: Follow a consistent style guide (like Airbnb, Google, or StandardJS) to maintain uniformity across your codebase.

// Use Strict Mode: Enable strict mode ('use strict';) at the beginning of scripts or functions to catch common coding mistakes and prevent the use of undeclared variables.
